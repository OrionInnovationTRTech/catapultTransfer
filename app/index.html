            <h2>What is Catapult?</h2>
            <p>Catapult is an open-source, P2P application that allows you to share files between your devices in fast and secure way. 
              You can share your files in your local network or create a room with a name you determine and share it with your friends.
            </p>

            <h2>How to use Catapult?</h2>
            <h3>Local Network</h3>
            <p>
              To share files in the same network, you need to be connected to the same network with the same public IP address.
              You can see others as nodes using Catapult if they are connected to the same network.
            </p>
            <h3>Rooms</h3>
            <p>
              To create a room, click on the + icon on the right hand corner and enter a room name.
              You can share the room name with your friends and they can join the room by entering the same name.
              You can see each other in the room as nodes.
            </p>
            <h3>File Transfer</h3>
            <p>
              To send a file, click on the node you want to send the file to and select the file you want to send.
              After the confirmation of the file transfer, you can see the progress of the file transfer around the node.
            </p>

            <h2>How it works?</h2>
            <p>
              Catapult uses WebRTC to establish a peer-to-peer connection between the nodes. 
              This means that there is no central server that stores your files. 
              Files are transferred directly between the nodes. 
              You can safely use Catapult if you are concerned about your privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              It might not work with some networks that uses Symetric NAT such as work networks.
